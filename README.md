# blog_application
An application made with node.js and EJS. JQuerry was utilized too.

If you want to run it you need still the node modules by running "npm install" or "npm i", then run with "node index.js" within the folder you put the project.

Feel free to edit or customize it, just remember to credit me if you do.
